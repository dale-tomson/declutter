# v1.1.3 (2025-12-09)

## 📦 Improvements

- **macOS Build**: Updated the packaging process to generate a proper `.app` bundle instead of a raw binary. This improves the user experience and aligns with standard macOS application structure.
- **Documentation**: Added clear instructions for macOS users to bypass the Gatekeeper "Not Opened" / "Malware" warning using the "Right-click -> Open" method.
